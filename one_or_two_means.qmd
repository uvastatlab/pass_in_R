## Example 3.2

We plan to measure hemoglobin A1c in a sample of 36 patients and conduct
a lower-tailed test at $\alpha = 0.05$ of

$$ 
H_0: \mu\ge5.7 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_A: \mu<5.7
$$

If true value of $\sigma$ is 2 and true population mean is 4.9, what is the power?

```{r}
library(powertools)
ttest.1samp(N = 36, delta = 4.9 - 5.7, sd = 2, alpha = 0.05, 
            power = NULL, sides = 1)
```

The power is about 0.76

```{r}
power.t.test(n = 36, delta = 5.7 - 4.9, sd = 2, sig.level = 0.05, 
             type = "one.sample", alternative = "one.sided")
```
