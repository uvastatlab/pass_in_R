If there truly is a difference of 0.05 in the population, we would like to estimate it within 0.025. That implies estimating a confidence interval with a width of 0.05. Assume the following:\n\nproportion of one group is 0.30\nproportion of the other group is 0.25\nconfidence interval width of 0.05\n\nUsing the prec_riskdiff() function from the presize package (Haynes et al. 2021), we can calculate this as follows. (The Newcombe method is the default method.)\n\nlibrary(presize)\nprec_riskdiff(p1 = 0.30, p2 = 0.25, conf.width = 0.05, method = \"newcombe\")\n\n\n     sample size for a risk difference with newcombe confidence interval \n\n   p1   p2       n1       n2     ntot r delta        lwr        upr conf.width\n1 0.3 0.25 2441.299 2441.299 4882.598 1  0.05 0.02495861 0.07495861       0.05\n  conf.level\n1       0.95\n\n\nTo estimate a difference in proportions with this precision, assuming the group proportions are each 0.30 and 0.25, we need to sample 2442 subjects in each group.\nOnce again, assumed proportions closer to 0 or 1 require smaller samples:\n\nprec_riskdiff(p1 = 0.05, p2 = 0.10, conf.width = 0.05, method = \"newcombe\")\n\n\n     sample size for a risk difference with newcombe confidence interval \n\n    p1  p2       n1       n2     ntot r delta         lwr         upr\n1 0.05 0.1 860.9835 860.9835 1721.967 1 -0.05 -0.07525428 -0.02525428\n  conf.width conf.level\n1       0.05       0.95\n\n\nLarger confidence widths also require smaller sample sizes. For example, to estimate a difference in proportions within 0.05 (i.e., confidence width of 0.1):\n\nprec_riskdiff(p1 = 0.05, p2 = 0.10, conf.width = 0.1, method = \"newcombe\")\n\n\n     sample size for a risk difference with newcombe confidence interval \n\n    p1  p2       n1       n2     ntot r delta        lwr           upr\n1 0.05 0.1 225.9885 225.9885 451.9769 1 -0.05 -0.1008756 -0.0008756156\n  conf.width conf.level\n1        0.1       0.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChampely, Stephane. 2020.

We’ll measure their BMI at the beginning of each school year in August. We would like sufficient power to detect a year trend of at least 0.25 if we recruit 15 students to the study. The null hypothesis we’ll test is that the year (slope) coefficient is 0. Rejecting this hypothesis provides evidence of a change in BMI over time. Assume the following:\n\nBetween group standard deviation of 3\nWithin group standard deviation 1\nSample size in each group: 4 obs each of 15 students\nEffect size of 0.25 (slope coefficient)\nIntercept coefficient: 20\nSignificance level of test: 0.01\nDirection of test: two-sided\n\nWe can use simulation to estimate the power of a hypothesis test on a specific coefficient in a model. This example uses the simr package (Green and MacLeod 2016).\nFirst we create a data frame of 4 observations each of 15 students.\n\nlibrary(simr)\nyear &lt;- 1:4\nstudent &lt;- 1:15\nd &lt;- expand.grid(year = year, student = student)\nhead(d, n = 8)\n\n  year student\n1    1       1\n2    2       1\n3    3       1\n4    4       1\n5    1       2\n6    2       2\n7    3       2\n8    4       2\n\n\nNow define our between and within group variance. Note that the simr package requires the between group variance be expressed as variance and the within group variance be expressed as standard deviation.\n\nbetween &lt;- 3^2 # random intercept variance\nwithin &lt;- 1 # residual standard deviation\n\nNext define our effects. We need to provide intercept and slope coefficients. The slope coefficient is the effect we will test. The intercept can be interpreted at the average BMI for the students’ first year of college.\n\nb &lt;- c(20, 0.25) # fixed intercept and slope\n\nNow define our model using the makeLmer() function. This function will simulate BMI values based on our hypothesized coefficients and variances.\n\nm &lt;- makeLmer(bmi ~ year + (1|student), \n              fixef = b, \n              VarCorr = between, \n              sigma = within, \n              data= d)\nprint(m)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: bmi ~ year + (1 | student)\n   Data: d\nREML criterion at convergence: 229.005\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Std.Dev.\n student  (Intercept) 3       \n Residual             1       \nNumber of obs: 60, groups:  student, 15\nFixed Effects:\n(Intercept)         year  \n      20.00         0.25  \n\n\nFinally use the powerSim() function to estimate the power of the test on the slope using 100 simulations. Setting progress = FALSE suppresses a progress bar which we don’t want to output in this online book. The seed argument makes the following result reproducible. The fixed() function dictates what coefficient we want to test. In this case we want to test the “year” coefficient using a “t” test.\n\n# power of test on slope\npowerSim(m, \n         test = fixed(\"year\", \"t\"),\n         seed = 1,\n         nsim = 100, \n         alpha = 0.01, \n         progress = FALSE)\n\nPower for predictor 'year', (95% confidence interval):\n      37.00% (27.56, 47.24)\n\nTest: t-test with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom (package lmerTest)\n      Effect size for year is 0.25\n\nBased on 100 simulations, (0 warnings, 0 errors)\nalpha = 0.01, nrow = 60\n\nTime elapsed: 0 h 0 m 6 s\n\n\nOur power is estimated to be about 0.37.

Let’s try increasing the sample size. We can do that with the extend() function. Below we increase the sample size to 30 and re-run the simulation.\n\nm2 &lt;- extend(m, along = \"student\", n = 30)\npowerSim(m2, \n         test = fixed(\"year\", \"t\"),\n         seed = 2,\n         nsim = 100, \n         alpha = 0.01, \n         progress = FALSE)\n\nPower for predictor 'year', (95% confidence interval):\n      64.00% (53.79, 73.36)\n\nTest: t-test with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom (package lmerTest)\n      Effect size for year is 0.25\n\nBased on 100 simulations, (0 warnings, 0 errors)\nalpha = 0.01, nrow = 120\n\nTime elapsed: 0 h 0 m 5 s\n\n\nPower is higher but still too low at 0.64.\nWe can generate a power curve with varying sample sizes using the powerCurve() function. First extend the data set by the maximum number of students we’re willing to entertain and then call the powerCurve() function. Below we specify a maximum of 40 students. Note this can take a while to run for large data sets and complex models. We have lowered the default number of simulations from 1000 to 100. The breaks argument says we want to try sample sizes ranging from 30 to 40 in steps of 2.\n\nm3 &lt;- extend(m, along = \"student\", n = 40)\npc &lt;- powerCurve(m3, \n                 test = fixed(\"year\", \"t\"), \n                 seed = 5,\n                 along = \"student\",\n                 breaks = seq(30,40,2),\n                 nsim = 100, \n                 alpha = 0.01,\n                 progress = FALSE)\nplot(pc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears we need about 38 students to achieve power of at least 0.80.",

    "text": "6.2 Post-Hoc Power\nPost-Hoc Power is not really a thing.\n\nIn studies that fail to yield “statistically significant” results, it is common for reviewers, or even editors, to ask the authors to include a post hoc power calculation. In such situations, editors would like to distinguish between true negatives and false negatives (concluding there is no effect, when there actually is an effect, and the study was just too small to pick it up). However, reporting post-hoc power is nothing more than reporting the p-value a different way, and will therefore not answer the question editors want to know.",
