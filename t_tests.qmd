## Two sample t-test

For sample size estimation based on _power_, we need the following:

- hypothesized difference in means (effect size)
- population standard deviation
- power of test 
- significance level of test
- direction of test: one or two-sided

### Example

We wish to run an experiment to test if the mean price of what male and female students pay at a library coffee shop is different. Our null hypothesis is no difference. We want to sample enough students to detect a difference of at least 75 cents. We're not sure which group pays more, so we'll do a two-sided test. Assume the following: 

- true difference is 0.75 cents
- population standard deviation is $2.25.
- we desire 0.9 power
- our significance level will be 0.05
- this will be two-sided test

Using base R [@R]:

```{r}
power.t.test(delta = 0.75, sd = 2.25, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9,
             alternative = "two.sided")
```

We should plan to observe 191 in each group.

Using the pwr package [@pwr], we must express effect size as Cohen's d: difference between the means divided by the population (or pooled) standard deviation.

```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.t.test(d = 0.75/2.25, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9, 
           alternative = "two.sided")
```

## Paired t-test

For sample size estimation based on _power_, we need the following:

- hypothesized difference between pairs (effect size)
- standard deviation of differences
- power of test 
- significance level of test
- direction of test: one or two-sided

### Example

We wish to run an experiment to see if an ultra-heavy rope-jumping program reduces 40-yard dash times. We will recruit young men ages 18 - 25 and measure their 40-yard dash time in seconds before the program and after. We'll use a paired t-test to see if the difference in times is greater than 0 (before - after). We want to sample enough subjects to detect a difference of 0.08 seconds. Assume the following:

- hypothesized difference of 0.08
- standard deviation of differences is 0.25
- we desire 0.9 power
- significance level of 0.05
- one-sided test since we assume dash times will only get faster

Using base R:

```{r}
power.t.test(delta = 0.08, sd = 0.25, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9, 
             type = "paired", alternative = "one.sided")
```

We should plan to sample at least 86 subjects.

Using the pwr package, we need to express the effect size as Cohen's d: difference in pairs divided by the standard deviation of the differences.

```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.t.test(power = 0.9, d = 0.08 / 0.25,
           type = "paired", alternative = "greater")
```
